# CGM Analysis
This script will take in data from xDrip continuous Glucose tracking, Garmin Activity Data, Cronometer Nutritional Data, and Oura Sleep Data and generate several visuals to correlate food, activity, sleep and glucose response data.

##Visuals
* Glucose Step Response for each meal
* HeatMap displaying Glucose over time periods and showing corresponding meals.
* Multiplot showing all step responses.  Meals are selectable to compare step responses in the same time period.
*
